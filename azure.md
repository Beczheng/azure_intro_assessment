#### **Part 2: Azure Exploration**
#### a. List of services:
|     | Compute | Database Services | Storage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Service #1 | Azure batch | Azure database migration service | Azure data share | 
| Service #2 | SQL Servers on virtual machines | Azure table storage | Archive storage |

#### b. Description of services:
- Compute
    - **Azure batch:** This service helps execute large tasks in the cloud. It can break a large task into smaller tasks and distribute them to run on multiple compute nodes (virtual machines). It also allows smaller tasks to be scheduled and monitored.
    - **SQL Servers on virtual machines:** This service allows the use of SQL Servers in the cloud without having to manage any physical hardware. In addition, it allows for backup, scaling, security, and flexibe licensing.
- Database services
    - **Azure database migration service:** This service helps move databases into the cloud efficiently and safely. It supports migration of databases, such as SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
    - **Azure table storage:** This service helps store non-relational structured data in the cloud. It provides a schemaless environment with keys and attributes.
- Storage
    - **Azure data share:** This service allows organizations to securely share data with customers and partners. It also allows organizations to control what they share, who receives the data, and the terms of use.
    - **Archive storage:** This service helps store rarely accessed data in a cost-effective manner. For example, it lowers storage costs but the increases access costs. In addition, it automatically encrypts the data.

#### c. How to interact with Azure services using Python:
- Can run a Python script on Azure batch.
- Can use Python to develop apps or services that use Azure Files to store file data.
- Can use client libraries for building apps with Python. The client libraries offer advanced capabilities for table storage.
